# Route Protection Implementation

This document explains how route protection is implemented in the Let's Connect frontend application.

## Overview

The application implements a comprehensive route protection system that ensures:
- **Public routes** redirect authenticated users to the dashboard
- **Protected routes** redirect unauthenticated users to the landing page

## Components

### 1. ProtectedRoute Component
- **Location**: `src/components/ProtectedRoute.tsx`
- **Purpose**: Wraps routes that require authentication
- **Behavior**: 
  - If user is not authenticated (`!isLoggedIn || !user`), redirects to `/`
  - If user is authenticated, renders the child component

### 2. PublicRoute Component
- **Location**: `src/components/PublicRoute.tsx`
- **Purpose**: Wraps routes that should not be accessible to authenticated users
- **Behavior**:
  - If user is authenticated (`isLoggedIn && user`), redirects to `/dashboard`
  - If user is not authenticated, renders the child component

### 3. Layout Components
- **PublicLayout**: `src/components/PublicLayout.tsx`
  - Used for public routes (landing, login, signup, etc.)
  - Includes navigation bar with login/logout functionality
  
- **Layout**: `src/components/Layout.tsx`
  - Used for protected routes
  - Minimal layout that works with DashboardShell

## Route Configuration

### Public Routes
The following routes are wrapped with `PublicRoute` and `PublicLayout`:
- `/` - Landing page
- `/home` - Home page
- `/login` - Login page
- `/signup` - Signup page
- `/forgot-password` - Forgot password page
- `/verify-otp` - OTP verification page
- `/create-new-password` - Create new password page

### Protected Routes
The following routes are wrapped with `ProtectedRoute` and `Layout`:
- `/dashboard` - Dashboard page
- `/appointments` - Appointments page
- `/appointments/:appointmentId` - Individual appointment page
- `/team` - Team page
- `/profile` - Profile page
- `/settings` - Settings page

## Authentication Context

The route protection relies on the `AuthContext` which:
- Manages authentication state (`isLoggedIn`)
- Stores user data (`user`)
- Persists authentication in localStorage with key `authUser`
- Provides `login()` and `logout()` functions

## How It Works

1. **User visits a public route while authenticated**:
   - `PublicRoute` detects authentication
   - Redirects to `/dashboard`

2. **User visits a protected route while not authenticated**:
   - `ProtectedRoute` detects lack of authentication
   - Redirects to `/`

3. **User visits a public route while not authenticated**:
   - `PublicRoute` allows access
   - Page renders normally

4. **User visits a protected route while authenticated**:
   - `ProtectedRoute` allows access
   - Page renders normally

## Implementation Details

- Uses React Router v6's `Navigate` component for redirects
- Authentication state is checked on every route change
- localStorage is used for persistence across browser sessions
- The system is reactive to authentication state changes

## Testing the Implementation

1. **Test public route protection**:
   - Login to the application
   - Try to visit `/login` or `/signup`
   - Should be redirected to `/dashboard`

2. **Test protected route protection**:
   - Logout from the application
   - Try to visit `/dashboard` or `/profile`
   - Should be redirected to `/`

3. **Test normal access**:
   - When not logged in, public routes should be accessible
   - When logged in, protected routes should be accessible
